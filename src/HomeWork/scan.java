/*2 String variables are already declared and assigned values.

        They will hold different topics we will learn.

        Using those variables print the message exactly like below.

        Ex:

        Assume `topic1 = "Java" and topic2 = "SQL"`

        You need to print exactly:

        `I will learn "Java" and "SQL" at CybertekSchool.`/*
