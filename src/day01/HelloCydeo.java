 /*
sdlc stam for softwar development life cicle and it has seven steps whitch is requerement analyst, project planning, design, coding, testing, deployment

and maintenance. If I am going to start from the requirement, the business analyst get together with the customer and get all of the requirement for bilding the application.
After the busisness analyst get all the information from the customer, they are going to the planing. They are going to make a plan on how they should to develop this part of
        the application
 and how they should do it. They will be talking about the cost, relise and this is going to happen in the palling section.
After they are done with the planing, they will go to the design, and in this steep the architecture will work on the design, once it is done, it will be handed to the
        developer
to write the code and develop the application. After the developer write the code, it will be hadded to tester, which is us, to make sure everything match with the
        requirement and expectation,
Once the testing is done, we can move to deployment. When the coddign goes to deployment it means that the customer can use that part of the code. If something happen after
the deployment, if the customer find any issue, or if something doesn't math with their expectation, it goes to maintanance, and in the maintanance they are going to
        change that or we can write the diffrent code
 then it goes to the same cicle again.  */
