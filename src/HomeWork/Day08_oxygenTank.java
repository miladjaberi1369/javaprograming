  // Create a class called OxygenTank. You are diving in the ocean. Your oxygen tank has a certain level (number) and you must print a message based on the level:
        //                Above 90 -  Your tank is full
        //                Above 80 -  Still okay
        //                Above 70 -  Don't go too far
        //                Above 60 -  Start to head back
        //                Above 50 -  Be careful now you at at 50%
